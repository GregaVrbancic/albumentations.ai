Define an augmentation pipeline. Read images from the disk. Pass images to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images. Step 1. Import the required libraries. Import Albumentations import albumentations as A Import a library to read images from the disk. In this example, we will use OpenCV . It is an open-source computer vision library that supports many image formats. Albumentations has OpenCV as a dependency, so you already have OpenCV installed. import cv2 Step 2. Define an augmentation pipeline. To define an augmentation pipeline, you need to create an instance of the Compose class. As an argument to the Compose class, you need to pass a list of augmentations you want to apply. A call to Compose will return a transform function that will perform image augmentation. Let's look at an example: transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 256 , height = 256 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ]) In the example, Compose receives a list with three augmentations: A.RandomCrop , A.HorizontalFlip , and A.RandomBrighntessContrast . You can find the full list of all available augmentations in the GitHub repository and in the API Docs . A demo playground that demonstrates how augmentations will transform the input image is available at https://albumentations-demo.herokuapp.com . To create an augmentation, you create an instance of the required augmentation class and pass augmentation parameters to it. A.RandomCrop receives two parameters, height and width . A.RandomCrop(width=256, height=256) means that A.RandomCrop will take an input image, extract a random patch with size 256 by 256 pixels from it and then pass the result to the next augmentation in the pipeline (in this case to A.HorizontalFlip ). A.HorizontalFlip in this example has one parameter named p . p is a special parameter that is supported by almost all augmentations. It controls the probability of applying the augmentation. p=0.5 means that with a probability of 50%, the transform will flip the image horizontally, and with a probability of 50%, the transform won't modify the input image. A.RandomBrighntessContrast in the example also has one parameter, p . With a probability of 20%, this augmentation will change the brightness and contrast of the image received from A.HorizontalFlip . And with a probability of 80%, it will keep the received image unchanged. A visualized version of the augmentation pipeline. You pass an image to it, the image goes through all transformations, and then you receive an augmented image from the pipeline. Step 3. Read images from the disk. To pass an image to the augmentation pipeline, you need to read it from the disk. The pipeline expects to receive an image in the form of a NumPy array. If it is a color image, it should have three channels in the following order: Red, Green, Blue (so a regular RGB image). To read images from the disk, you can use OpenCV - a popular library for image processing. It supports a lot of input formats and is installed along with Albumentations since Albumentations utilizes that library under the hood for a lot of augmentations. To import OpenCV import cv2 To read an image with OpenCV image = cv2 . imread ( \"/path/to/image.jpg\" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2RGB ) Note the usage of cv2.cvtColor . For historical reasons , OpenCV reads an image in BGR format (so color channels of the image have the following order: Blue, Green, Red). Albumentations uses the most common and popular RGB image format. So when using OpenCV, we need to convert the image format to RGB explicitly. Besides OpenCV, you can use other image processing libraries. Pillow Pillow is a popular Python image processing library. Install Pillow pip install pillow Import Pillow and NumPy (we need NumPy to convert a Pillow image to a NumPy array. NumPy is already installed along with Albumentations). from PIL import Image import numpy as np Read an image with Pillow and convert it to a NumPy array. pillow_image = Image . open ( \"image.jpg\" ) image = np . array ( pillow_image ) Step 4. Pass images to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images. To pass an image to the augmentation pipeline you need to call the transform function created by a call to A.Compose at Step 2. In the image argument to that function, you need to pass an image that you want to augment. transformed = transform ( image = image ) transform will return a dictionary with a single key image . Value at that key will contain an augmented image. transformed_image = transformed [ \"image\" ] To augment the next image, you need to call transform again and pass a new image as the image argument: another_transformed_image = transform ( image = another_image )[ \"image\" ] Each augmentation will change the input image with the probability set by the parameter p . Also, many augmentations have parameters that control the magnitude of changes that will be applied to an image. For example, A.RandomBrightnessContrast has two parameters: brightness_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting brightness and contrast_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting contrast. The bigger the value, the more the augmentation will change an image. During augmentation, a magnitude of the transformation is sampled from a uniform distribution limited by brightness_limit and contrast_limit . That means that if you make multiple calls to transform with the same input image, you will get a different output image each time. transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( brightness_limit = 1 , contrast_limit = 1 , p = 1 ), ]) transformed_image_1 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ] transformed_image_2 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ] transformed_image_3 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ]","title":"Augmenting images"},{"location":"getting_started/augmenting_images/#step-1-import-the-required-libraries","text":"Import Albumentations import albumentations as A Import a library to read images from the disk.

However, it often very difficult to get enough training samples. Multiple reasons could make it very hard or even impossible to gather enough data: To make a training dataset, you need to obtain images and then label them. For example, you need to assign correct class labels if you have an image classification task. For an object detection task, you need to draw bounding boxes around objects. For a semantic segmentation task, you need to assign a correct class to each input image pixel. This process requires manual labor, and sometimes it could be very costly to label the training data. For example, to correctly label medical images, you need expensive domain experts. Sometimes even collecting training images could be hard. There are many legal restrictions for working with healthcare data, and obtaining it requires a lot of effort. Sometimes getting the training images is more feasible, but it will cost a lot of money. For example, to get satellite images, you need to pay a satellite operator to take those photos. To get images for road scene recognition, you need an operator that will drive a car and collect the required data. Image augmentation to the rescue Image augmentation is a process of creating new training examples from the existing ones. To make a new sample, you slightly change the original image. For instance, you could make a new image a little brighter; you could cut a piece from the original image; you could make a new image by mirroring the original one, etc. Here are some examples of transformations of the original image that will create a new training sample. By applying those transformations to the original training dataset, you could create an almost infinite amount of new training samples. How much does image augmentation improves the quality and performance of deep neural networks Basic augmentations techniques were used almost in all papers that describe the state-of-the-art models for image recognition. AlexNet was the first model that demonstrated exceptional capabilities of using deep neural networks for image recognition. For training, the authors used a set of basic image augmentation techniques. They resized original images to the fixed size of 256 by 256 pixels, and then they cropped patches of size 224 by 224 pixels as well as their horizontal reflections from those resized images. Also, they altered the intensities of the RGB channels in images. Successive state-of-the-art models such as Inception , ResNet , and EfficientNet also used image augmentation techniques for training. In 2018 Google published a paper about AutoAugment - an algorithm that automatically discovers the best set of augmentations for the dataset. They showed that a custom set of augmentations improves the performance of the model. Here is a comparison between a model that used only the base set of augmentations and a model that used a specific set of augmentations discovered by AutoAugment. The table shows Top-1 accuracy (%) on the ImageNet validation set; higher is better. Model Base augmentations AutoAugment augmentations ResNet-50 76.3 77.6 ResNet-200 78.5 80.0 AmoebaNet-B (6,190) 82.2 82.8 AmoebaNet-C (6,228) 83.1 83.5 The table demonstrates that a diverse set of image augmentations improves the performance of neural networks compared to a base set with only a few most popular transformation techniques.

Here is an example of how you could use Pillow , a popular image processing library for Python, to make simple augmentations. from PIL import Image , ImageEnhance image = Image . open ( \"parrot.jpg\" ) mirrored_image = image . transpose ( Image . FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT ) rotated_image = image . rotate ( 45 ) brightness_enhancer = ImageEnhance . Brightness ( image ) brighter_image = brightness_enhancer . enhance ( factor = 1.5 ) However, this approach has many limitations, and it doesn't handle all cases with image augmentation. An image augmentation library such as Albumentations gives you a lot of advantages. Here is a list of few pitfalls that augmentation libraries can handle very well. The need to apply the same transform to an image and for labels for segmentation, object detection, and keypoint detection tasks. For image classification, you need to modify only an input image and keep output labels intact because output labels are invariant to image modifications. Note There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, an image could contain a cat and have an assigned label cat . During image augmentation, if you crop a part of an image that doesn't have a cat on it, then the output label cat becomes wrong and misleading. Usually, you deal with those situations by deciding which augmentations you could apply to a dataset without risking to have problems with incorrect labels. For segmentation, you need to apply some transformations both to an input image and an output mask. You also have to use the same parameters both for the image transformation and the mask transformation. Let's look at an example of a semantic segmentation task from Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset. The dataset contains aerial photos as well as masks for those photos. Each pixel of the mask is marked either as 1 if the pixel belongs to the class building and 0 otherwise. There are two types of image augmentations: pixel-level augmentations and spatial-level augmentations. Pixel-level augmentations change the values of pixels of the original image, but they don't change the output mask. Image transformations such as changing brightness or contrast of adjusting values of the RGB-palette of the image are pixel-level augmentations. We modify the input image by adjusting its brightness, but we keep the output mask intact. On the contrary, spatial-level augmentations change both the image and the mask. When you apply image transformations such as mirroring or rotation or cropping a part of the input image, you also need to apply the same transformation to the output label to preserve its correctness. We rotate both the input image and the output mask. We use the same set of transformations with the same parameters, both for the image and the mask. The same is true for object detection tasks. For pixel-level augmentations, you only need to change the input image. With spatial-level augmentations, you need to apply the same transformation not only to the image but for bounding boxes coordinates as well. After applying spatial-level augmentations, you need to update coordinates of bounding boxes to represent the correct locations of objects on the augmented image. Pixel-level augmentations such as brightness adjustment change only the input image but not the coordinates of bounding boxes. Spatial-level augmentations such as mirroring and cropping a part of the image change both the input image and the bounding boxes' coordinates. Albumentations knows how to correctly apply transformation both to the input data as well as the output labels. Working with probabilities During training, you usually want to apply augmentations with a probability of less than 100% since you also need to have the original images in your training pipeline. Also, it is beneficial to be able to control the magnitude of image augmentation, how much does the augmentation change the original image. If the original dataset is large, you could apply only the basic augmentations with probability around 10-30% and with a small magnitude of changes. If the dataset is small, you need to act more aggressively with augmentations to prevent overfitting of neural networks, so you usually need to increase the probability of applying each augmentation to 40-50% and increase the magnitude of changes the augmentation makes to the image. Image augmentation libraries allow you to set the required probabilities and the magnitude of values for each transformation. Declarative definition of the augmentation pipeline and unified interface Usually, you want to apply not a single augmentation, but a set of augmentations with specific parameters such as probability and magnitude of changes. Augmentation libraries allow you to declare such a pipeline in a single place and then use it for image transformation through a unified interface. Some libraries can store and load transformation parameters to formats such as JSON, YAML, etc. Here is an example definition of an augmentation pipeline. This pipeline will first crop a random 512px x 512px part of the input image. Then with probability 30%, it will randomly change brightness and contrast of that crop. Finally, with probability 30%, it will horizontally flip the resulting image. import albumentations as A transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( 512 , 512 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.3 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), ]) Rigorous testing A bug in the augmentation pipeline could easily go unnoticed. A buggy pipeline could silently corrupt input data. There won't be any exceptions and code failures, but the performance of trained neural networks will degrade because they received a garbage input during training. Augmentation libraries usually have large test suites that capture regressions during development. Also large user base helps to find unnoticed bugs and report them to developers.","title":"Why you need a dedicated library for image augmentation"},{"location":"introduction/why_you_need_a_dedicated_library_for_image_augmentation/#the-need-to-apply-the-same-transform-to-an-image-and-for-labels-for-segmentation-object-detection-and-keypoint-detection-tasks","text":"For image classification, you need to modify only an input image and keep output labels intact because output labels are invariant to image modifications.
